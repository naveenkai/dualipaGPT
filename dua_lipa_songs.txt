If you don't wanna see me
Did a full 180, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now
Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word "goodbye"?
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now ('bout me now, 'bout me)
Oh, oh
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up
Don't start now (oh)
Oh, oh
Don't come out, out
I'm not where you left me at all, so
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
Don't show up (don't show up), don't come out (don't come out)
Don't start caring about me now ('bout me now)
Walk away (walk away), you know how (you know how)
Don't start caring about me now (so)
Oh, oh
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up
Walk away, walk away (so)
Oh, oh
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up
Walk away, walk away, oh

If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take you for a ride
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
You, moonlight, you're my starlight (you're the moonlight)
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
I believe that you're for me, I feel it in our energy
I see us written in the stars
We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never, baby
Nothing's ever, ever too far
Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes
Shining just the way we are
I feel like we're forever, every time we get together
But whatever, let's get lost on Mars
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
You, moonlight, you're my starlight (you're the moonlight)

Baby, let me take you for a ride

And I'm feeling so electric, dance my arse off
And even if I wanted to, I can't stop
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need
Let me take the night, I love real easy
And I know that you'll still wanna see me
On the Sunday morning, music real loud
Let me love you while the moon is still out
Something in you, lit up heaven in me
The feeling won't let me sleep
'Cause I'm lost in the way you move, the way you feel
One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me

Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
(Too many times, too many times)
My love
He makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love
He doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in, you'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the mornin'
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him
I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards
(Nowhere to turn) no way
(Nowhere to turn) no
Now I'm standin' back from it, I finally see the pattern
(I never learn, I never learn)
But my love (love)
He doesn't love me, so I tell myself
I tell myself, I do, I do, I do
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in, you have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the mornin'
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him
I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
Practice makes perfect, I'm still tryna learn it by heart (I got new rules, I count 'em)
Eat, sleep and breathe it, rehearse and repeat it, 'cause I (I got new, I got new, I...)
One: Don't pick up the phone (yeah)
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone (alone)
Two: Don't let him in, you have to kick him out again (again)
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the mornin' (bed in the mornin')
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him
I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
(Whoa-ooh, whoa-ooh, whoa)
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
(Baby, you know I count 'em)
I gotta tell them to myself
Don't let him in, don't let him in, don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend, don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't let him in, don't let him in, don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend, don't, don't, don't
You gettin' over him


I've always been the one to say the first goodbye
Had to love and lose a hundred million times
Had to get it wrong to know just what I like
Now I'm fallin'
You say my name like I have never heard before
I'm indecisive but this time I know for sure
I hope I'm not the only one that feels it all
Are you fallin'?
Center of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
Now I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doin' better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I know that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love
With the one that could break my heart?
Oh no, I was doin' better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I know that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love
With the one that could break my heart?
I wonder when you go, if I stay on your mind
Two can play that game, but you win me every time
Everyone before you was a waste of time
Yeah, you got me
Center of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
Now I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doin' better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I know that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love
With the one that could break my heart?
Oh no, I was doin' better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I know that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love
With the one that could break my heart?
Ooh, break my heart
Ooh, break my heart
Ooh
Am I falling in love
With the one that could break my heart?
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doin' better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I know that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love
With the one that could break my heart?
Oh no, I was doin' better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I know that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love
With the one that could break my heart?

You call me all friendly
Telling me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday
You have got me wrong
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been moving on, since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love, so you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
You say you're sorry
But it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creeping
You blamed it all on the alcohol
So I made my decision
'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it
Play the victim and switch your position
I'm through, I'm done
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been moving on, since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love, so you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
You say you're sorry
But it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
I see you tryna get to me
I see you begging on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna get to me
Tchh, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fu-u-uck
About you
No, I don't give a damn
You keep reminiscing on when you were my man
But I'm over you
Now you're all in the past
You talk all that sweet talk, but I ain't coming back
Cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
(I'll tell you why)
You say you're sorry
But it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
(Too late now)
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
(Boy, I don't give a fuck)
I see you tryna get to me
I see you begging on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna get to me (get to me)
Tchh, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck


Common love isn't for us
We created something phenomenal
Don't you agree? Don't you agree?
You got me feeling diamond-rich
Nothing on this planet compares to it
Don't you agree? Don't you agree?
Who needs to go to sleep when I got you next to me?
All night, I'll riot with you
I know you got my back, and you know I got you
So come on (come on), come on (come on), come on (come on)
Let's get physical
Lights out, follow the noise
Baby, keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice
So come on (come on), come on (come on), come on
Let's get physical
Adrenaline keeps on rushing in
Love the simulation we're dreaming in
Don't you agree? Don't you agree?
I don't wanna live another life
'Cause this one's pretty nice
Living it up
Who needs to go to sleep when I got you next to me?
All night, I'll riot with you
I know you got my back, and you know I got you
So come on (come on), come on (come on), come on (come on)
Let's get physical
Lights out, follow the noise
Baby, keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice
So come on (come on), come on (come on), come on
Let's get physical
Hold on just a little tighter
Come on, hold on, tell me if you're ready
Come on (come on, come on)
Baby, keep on dancing
Let's get physical
Hold on just a little tighter
Come on, hold on, tell me if you're ready
Come on (come on, come on)
Baby, keep on dancing
Let's get physical
All night, I'll riot with you
I know you got my back, and you know I got you
So come on, come on, come on
Let's get physical
Lights out, follow the noise
Baby, keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice
So come on (come on), come on (come on), come on
Let's get physical (physical, physical)
Let's get physical (physical, physical)
Physical (physical, physical)
Let's get physical (physical, physical)
Come on, phy-phy-phy-physical
